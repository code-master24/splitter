*** This review may contain spoilers *** I don't know why, but watching the film \"Passengers\" I have raised in my soul nostalgic memories about the album, \"Ð•lectric Light Orchestra\" (\"ELO\") \"Time\" (1981), the theme songs on which the fate of a man caught with the help of a time machine in the year 2095 and are not able to come back. I especially remember the song \"21st Century Man\", the meaning of which is that despite all the great technical achievements of mankind of the 21st century, they themselves do not make people happier, and even on the contrary, make more aware of their loneliness:\n\"Fly across the city, rise upon the land,\nYou can do most anything,\nNow you are twenty first century man.\nYou should be so happy, you should be so glad.\nSo why are you so lonely, you twenty first century man?\"\nIn my opinion, the main theme in \"Passengers\" is the theme of human loneliness. How it is shown in the film, deserves a separate description, but to avoid spoilers let me just say that at all times the universal, and yet the only cure for this epidemic of our age is the Love, and it is capitalized. This is light feeling that had test heroes Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, it helped them better understand themselves and defined the whole meaning of their lives. No matter in what conditions was their fateful meeting, the important thing is what impact it has had on the future of Aurora lane and Jim Preston, through some painful doubts, fears and uneasiness were the heroes on the way to the realization of a common destiny that bound them aboard the space ship \"Avalon\". I believe it is the desire to live \"here and now\" in the earthly present, not \"someday\" in the future transcendental determined the final mutual decision of the lovers.\nAs for the actors, I can say that they excellently managed with their images. Chris Pratt was able to show courageous and at the same time, not alien to romance man, which by the fate, or maybe, by the chance, took, perhaps, the most difficult decision of his life. I respect and love Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I don't think that her roles as a strong and independent heroines somehow spoil her, on the contrary, it perfectly reflects her character and willpower. Here, as in \"The Hunger Games\", the actress showed herself from the best side, performing the role of a young writer feeling a certain emptiness in life and seeking to fill the dream of a new life. But, as often happened in life, what we seek is sometimes much closer than we think, it is enough to look inside yourself and look around, and we understood what is our main earthly value, not illusory, though very attractive and alluring.\nA film for romantics and those who love and appreciate a movie that raises questions about major life issues such as loneliness, finding yourself and your place in this world, and, of course, about love as a unique way of coping with reality and at the same time to escape from it.\n\"When you feel your ship is sinking,\nWhen you feel your heart is breaking,\nHold on tight to your dream\"! (\"ELO\",\"Hold On Tight To Your Dream\").
I saw this film tonight because there's a lot of great movies out there But I'm not good with violence, so i was told this was the least violent of the three. (other choices were 'silence' and 'hacksaw ridge') I was very impressed by what I saw. I don't know all the facts, but i do know liberties were taken as Mark Wahlberg's character is an amalgamation of a bunch of people, so how much else of this movie is true, I'm not sure. I'm also not sure why this film hasn't been a bigger hit. interestingly enough, i just so happened to have dinner plans with my friend after this film, who is a boston native. she she says she believes the film hasn't done well because it's too soon, that she or no one she knows will go see it yet because it's too emotional. I can see that because the film WAS very emotional, striking a good balance between action and heartfelt drama. you feel a lump in your throat the whole time at all the devastation. Personally, I thought it was a very good film, and highly recommended.
